# Cloud Security Web App Enhancement Challenge

## Challenge Objective üéØ

Enhance or modify an existing security web application (e.g., Password Strength Checker) and deploy it using either Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS). The goal is to improve functionality, security, or performance of the web app and ensure it's correctly deployed and functioning in the cloud.

## Key Requirements

1. **Enhance/Modify the App**: Make significant improvements or add new features to the provided security web app.
2. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the modified app using the services outlined below for either GCP or AWS.
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate GitHub Actions (or similar tool) to automatically deploy updates to your cloud environment when you push to your repository.

## Cloud Provider Requirements

### GCP Requirements:
- **Compute Engine**: Host the web application.
- **Cloud Storage/FireStore**: Use for any persistent storage needs.
- **Cloud Run** (Optional): Containerize and deploy for serverless deployment.
- **IAM**: Set up appropriate roles and permissions.
- **Cloud Build**: Integrate for CI/CD.

### AWS Requirements:
- **EC2**: Host the web application.
- **S3/DynamoDB**: Use for any persistent storage needs.
- **Lambda** (Optional): Package as a Lambda function for serverless deployment.
- **IAM**: Set up appropriate roles and permissions.
- **CodePipeline**: Integrate for CI/CD.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/security-web-app.git
cd security-web-app
Step 2: Set Up Locally
bashCopypip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
Step 3: Implement Enhancements
Enhance the web app. For example:

Add a strength meter to the Password Strength Checker.

Step 4: Deploy to the Cloud
Choose either GCP or AWS for deployment.
GCP Deployment:

Compute Engine VM:
bashCopygcloud compute ssh your-vm-instance
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/security-web-app.git
cd security-web-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

Cloud Run: Containerize the app using Docker and deploy to Cloud Run.

AWS Deployment:

EC2 Instance:
bashCopyssh ec2-user@your-ec2-instance
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/security-web-app.git
cd security-web-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

Lambda Function: Package the app as a Lambda function and set up an API Gateway.

Step 5: Set Up CI/CD
Integrate GitHub Actions for automatic deployment. Refer to GitHub Actions documentation for setup.
