#Cloud Security Web App Enhancement Challenge

Challenge Objective üéØ

Welcome to the Cloud Security App Enhancement Challenge. In this project, you will have the opportunity to enhance or modify an existing security web application and deploy it using a cloud provider of your choice (GCP or AWS). The primary goal is to improve the functionality, security, or performance of the web app and ensure it is correctly deployed and functioning in the cloud.

Key Requirements

Enhance/Modify the App: Make significant improvements or add new features to the provided security web app (e.g., Password Strength Checker).
Cloud Deployment: Deploy the modified app using the services outlined below for either GCP or AWS.
CI/CD Integration: Integrate GitHub Actions (or a similar tool) to automatically deploy updates to your cloud environment whenever you push to your repository.

GCP Requirements:

Compute Engine: Use Google Compute Engine to host the web application.
Cloud Storage/FireStore: Use Google Cloud Storage or Firestore for any persistent storage needs.
Cloud Run: Optionally, you can containerize the application and deploy it using Cloud Run for a serverless deployment.
IAM (Identity and Access Management): Set up appropriate IAM roles and permissions to secure access to your resources.
Cloud Build: Integrate with Cloud Build for CI/CD to automatically deploy updates to your application.

AWS Requirements:

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Use AWS EC2 to host the web application.
S3/DynamoDB: Use Amazon S3 or DynamoDB for any persistent storage needs.
Lambda: Optionally, you can package the application as a Lambda function for a serverless deployment.
IAM (Identity and Access Management): Set up appropriate IAM roles and permissions to secure access to your resources.
CodePipeline: Integrate with AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD to automatically deploy updates to your application.
Getting Started üöÄ
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the provided GitHub repository containing the base code for the security web app.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/security-web-app.git
cd security-web-app
Step 2: Set Up Locally
Set up the development environment locally to run the web app.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
Step 3: Implement Enhancements
Enhance or modify the web app according to the challenge requirements. Examples of enhancements include:

Adding a strength meter to the Password Strength Checker.

Step 4: Deploy to the Cloud
GCP Deployment Instructions:
Compute Engine VM:
SSH into the VM.
Clone the modified repository.
Install dependencies and run the app.
bash
Copy code
gcloud compute ssh your-vm-instance
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/security-web-app.git
cd security-web-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
Cloud Run:
Containerize the app using Docker.
Deploy the Docker image to Cloud Run.
AWS Deployment Instructions:
EC2 Instance:
SSH into the EC2 instance.
Clone the modified repository.
Install dependencies and run the app.
bash
Copy code
ssh ec2-user@your-ec2-instance
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/security-web-app.git
cd security-web-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
Lambda Function:
Package the app as a Lambda function.
Set up an API Gateway to route requests to the Lambda function.
Step 5: Set Up CI/CD
Integrate GitHub Actions to automatically package and deploy your serverless function on every push to the repository. Refer to the GitHub Actions documentation for setup instructions.
